        "tutorial": "<p>SAKURA School Simulator is packed with tons of features and activities to engage in and offers you utmost liberty in fully immersing yourself within its world. There is plenty of fun to have exploring the vast town of Sakura on your own and, of course,venturing blindly into the unknown is a journey we go behind as well. Considering everything, it helps to have an idea of some basic features and game mechanics built into SAKURA School Simulator as there are still an abundant supply of things to discover on your own moving forward.</p></br><p>For starters, choosing which main character to choose and how you decide to dress up is not as critical. There are 2 main characters available and you can unlock 3 more after watching a short video ad for each of them. While that in itself is already cool, what makes it even better is the fact that you can instantly shift controls across all 5 characters.</p></br><p>Starting a new game will have you control Rina Tamaki. You can immediately change to a different character by clicking on the menu button at the upper left side of the screen and choosing a character on the bottom left side of the window. Each character has a different starting point, which is their home, where several items can typically be found. You can choose to customize your character’s appearance before diving into the game and can edit as much as you want within their residence, indicated aby a circle on the floor of the designated areas.</p>"

        "tutorial": "<p>There are plenty of clothes, masks, and glasses to choose from and while the plethora of choices is more than enough to fill your needs and wants as far as customizations go, there are plenty of outfits and costumes that are beyond mere cosmetics. An excellent example of this is the Alice in Wonderland dress that you can unlock after watching a video ad. This dress comes with a special ability that can increase or decrease your character’s size.</p><p>There are clothes that also change your appearance drastically like the baby costume and the ranger outfit. There are costumes like the kunoichi that increases your movement speed, a witch costume that comes with a wand that can shoot off fireballs, a police officer armed with a baton and a revolver, or even a shrine maiden with a unique supernatural ability.</p><p>On the game screen, a lot of the icons are self-explanatory although some require a bit of understanding for complete beginners. The virtual d-pad used to control the character’s movement is invisible and appears only when you touch anywhere on the left half of the screen. You can adjust your view by touching and swiping on the right side of the screen as well.</p>"

The button on the lower right corner show what you will use if you attack. You will start off with just your fists, which are quite fierce on its own but you will have plenty of weapons to acquire later on.</p><p>You can tap on the zoom button to change the perspective on the go and SAKURA School Simulator also comes with a jetpack button that lets you levitate and fly across town. When using the jetpack, moving will constantly glide you down. You need to use the jump button on its own to move upwards and hold it while moving around to keep you in the air. A Dash button also appears above the action button when using the jetpack. This is a very useful tool to get you places faster as well as flee from danger when you need to.</p><p>You can see your life bar at the upper right side of the screen. There is a camera you can click on for a quick screen capture and a save button that you will have to use from time to time. Keep in mind that not saving your game will make you lose all progress. It is best to save as often as you can and especially when taking on a difficult quest or planning to do something that will negatively impact your progress.</p>"

        "tutorial": "<p>As much as everything with a life bar in SAKURA School Simulator can be killed, including yourself, no one actually ever dies in Sakura Town. Reducing the life bar to zero only causes the character to faint. In your case, you can always choose to play a video ad to continue where you left off as fainting and regressing can be a hassle in some situations. For all other NPCs, fainting will bring them back again the following day.</p><p>There are 5 basic icons on the left side of the screen to take note of: the “thumbs up” icon shows the degree of your popularity; the coffin counts the number of people you fainted for the day; the heart is for the number of lovers; the win person symbolizes the number of your friends; and the frown represents the number of people who are pursuing you. Note that these statistics are separate and distinct for each character, giving you more reasons to switch from one character to the next just in case one is in trouble.</p>"

By using the map, you can also call on friends and lovers and they will come to you if possible. The mission and help buttons are self-explanatory and needs to be check out especially when you have just started your adventure.</p><p>The menu button holds a variety of options. In addition to seeing your status and being to control the weather as well as teleport to any location at will, you can also move forward in time through the system settings. As some of the events only take place within a certain period of time, you can opt to fast forward time instead of manually waiting for the next cycle in instances where you miss an event.</p><p>There are way too many options in the menu to discuss in full detail but other than the ones we mentioned, perhaps one important configuration you will find useful relates to the quality settings of the game in case your device is struggling to run the game on very high settings.</p>"

What can happen is that the police will be alerted to your misdeed and police everywhere will start chasing you around. Sometimes, not doing anything wrong can also result in people pursuing you. Stepping into a Yakuza territory, for one, can lead all Yakuza members to start chasing after you.</p>"

If he or she attacks and hits the other NPC, the next fights will continue to revolve around them.</p><p>This is actually a fun and effective way of getting either the Yakuza or the police off your backs. If you are being chased by the Yakuza, heading over to a police station and strategizing to let the Yakuza member strike an officer of the law leaves you free of their nuisance. On the other hand, you can also lead the police officer or officers towards the Yakuza headquarters for an enjoyable brawl to watch.</p>"

The more friends and lovers you have, the more help you can get whenever you call and there are numerous reasons that calling on some friends can be very helpful.</p><p>Increasing fondness can be instantly done by buying a love potion from the Sakura Corporation if you have 10,000 yen on you that you are willing to spend on it. There are plenty of cool items you can purchase here as well.</p>"

As it may easily fill you with overflowing excitement to nab your first weapon, keep in mind that it comes with a price.

The moths have no way of hurting you or the NPC but given how quickly they move and their numbers may lead to you accidentally hurting the NPC.</p><p>You can complete this quest using only your fist and you can use a jump attack or your jetpack if some moths stay above you.

This is rather difficult because there will be lots of people in the class as well. You need a good enough level of precision to kill 5 monkfishes and remember to save before engaging.
